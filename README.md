## 📁 Files

- `car_price_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `cleaned_car_data.csv` – Cleaned version of the dataset
- `plots/` – Folder containing saved visualizations

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and features of the dataset
- Clean and preprocess raw data (fix typos, derive new columns)
- Visualize relationships between car price and features like:
  - Fuel type
  - Engine size
  - Car body
  - Brand
- Derive business-level insights from the data

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Diesel cars are generally priced higher than gasoline cars
- Engine size and horsepower are strongly correlated with price
- Convertibles and hardtops are among the most expensive car types
- Some brand names were inconsistently labeled and corrected in preprocessing
